# Shoulder exoskeleton – Viexo project

## Main Controller:
This folder contains an .ino code written for the Teensy 4.1.
The current controller used is Julian_AAN_v4_1_T.ino.

## GUI:
To receive, plot and save data from Teensy, run Exo_Interface_Teensy_v1.py.
The code allows you to start and stop the exoskeleton. It is also possible to change the tuning parameters a and alpha, as well as the sine wave parameters.
